# ohmypet

This repository contains the source code for my Final Year Project (FYP) in Bachelor of Software Engineering. The project aims to improve pet service management workflow, enabling reservation creation, viewing, and management, offering packages, and loyalty points rewards, it also included staff management. 

# After FYP ended
This system is a mobile application, the structure of this flutter project is not mature, because it was the first flutter project I made within a month. Due to the time constrain, I have left this project with many spaces of improvement. It is not my end, but my starting point. Feel free to view if you're looking for a reference.
